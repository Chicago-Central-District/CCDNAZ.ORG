            <p>
              Our 2025 District Assembly is in the books—and what a meaningful, joy-filled time it was! We began Friday night with a powerful celebration service featuring the Proclamation Gospel Choir, honored our retiring ministers, and recognized those newly licensed for ministry.

            <p>
              Saturday morning began with the business of the Assembly, but it was far from routine—we heard inspiring reports that reminded us of God’s faithfulness. Daryl Cripe brought a powerful challenge, calling us to seek after the one…until… Altars were filled as people committed to Holy Spirit-led relationships.

            <p class="section-paragraph-2">
                These groups will be shaped by those involved, and we invite pastors to fill out this form to share your interests or suggest a group you’d like to lead—you’re not signing up yet, just helping us shape what’s next. We’ll reach out in the coming weeks with next steps.
