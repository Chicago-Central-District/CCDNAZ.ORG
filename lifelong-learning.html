                    Everyone moves through a series of changes in the course of a lifetime in ministry. 
                    The combination of changes in society, technology, ministry assignments, and personal development means <strong>a minister is constantly in need of more preparation for the ministry assignment</strong> in which he or she serves. 
                    Often that preparation is informal, but the Church of the Nazarene also asks its ministers to provide accountability for <strong>lifelong learning</strong> through a more formal process of continuing education. 
                    <br><br>
                    <span>Every minister needs 20 hours of lifelong learning every year. </span>
                    <br><br>
                    You can acquire lifelong learning hours through any extended learning activity. Failure to complete these requirements for more than two consecutive years will result in being required to meet with the BOM at their regular meeting time. 
                    The BOM will give guidance in completing the lifelong learning required. <strong>It is your responsibility to report your activity on the Lifelong Learning Registry.</strong>

            <h2>How do I do It?</h2>
            
            <p>
                At district-sponsored events, we provide event codes for lifelong learning that can be used to quickly fill out the form on the lifelong learning registry.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                If you host a group event (like a mission area meeting), contact our district lifelong learning coordinator, 
                <a href="mailto:cooksd7@aol.com">Steve Cook (cooksd7@aol.com)</a>, and he can create a code for you.
            </p>
    
            <h3>At other non-district events</h3>
            <p>
                A preaching seminar, administration course, Biblical conference, leadership workshop, etc.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Academic Study</h3>
            <p>
                If you are currently fulfilling the course of study requirements for ministry, you are not required to fulfill the continuing education requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Classes taken outside an academic degree program may fulfill the requirement for continuing education.
            </p>
            <p>
                As graduate programs are not recorded as continuing education through Global Clergy Development, a minister enrolled in a degree program is to provide annually to the District Coordinator a transcript indicating his or her progress in the degree program.
            </p>
            <p>
                In reporting to the District Board of Ministry on the status of the lifelong learning endeavors of a minister enrolled in a degree program, the Coordinator may simply report to Global Clergy Development, “Currently enrolled in a degree program.”
            </p>
    
            <h3>Read</h3>
            <p>
                We all need to study to stay fresh on our theology, biblical studies, ministerial preparation, spiritual formation, and a multitude of other topics that directly affect our leadership style, preaching content, and ministry. This can be used for lifelong learning credit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choose a handful of books you would like to read for credit. For every 30 hours of reading, you receive 10 lifelong learning hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Report your reading on the lifelong learning registry.
